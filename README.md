# code-snippets
free to use/modify code snippets for use in Unity with C#. By Wobl

Hello there, fellow humans! I'm Wobl.
I have created this repository for you to copy/paste code into your Unity project, if needed.
This is just if you need a special kind of 8-line-code (for example) and you don't know where to find it.
Here, you will find many kinds of pieces of code, for anything you need, typed in the simplest way possible.
